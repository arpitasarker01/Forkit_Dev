# forkit-core

**Open-source AI passports with deterministic IDs and lineage.**

AI models and agents often move across repos, tools, teams, and runtimes without stable identity, lineage, or verification. `forkit-core` gives them portable passports: deterministic IDs, provenance links, artifact hashes, lineage records, and CI-friendly validation.

Create a passport locally. Verify it in GitHub CI. Keep the identity portable. Connect it to Forkit.dev later when you need hosted visibility or governance workflows.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Forkit-Dev-Core/Forkit_Dev.git
cd Forkit_Dev
pip install -e .

python examples/deterministic_identity_demo.py
```

That demo shows the core property:

- same stable passport inputs => same deterministic `passport_id`
- changed artifact or creator => different `passport_id`

Example output:

```text
Forkit deterministic passport demo

same input               ddfd461f5fc78574c3244da346f64bf3b1d95e83e0dfe174209937f9d561bd0b
same input again         ddfd461f5fc78574c3244da346f64bf3b1d95e83e0dfe174209937f9d561bd0b
changed artifact         e271004e8f9e83d9e81f8f5d3d35736c4e4bf841d46d821d74b59e439d6f3cea
changed creator          f78fb6bf1d7feee0fb2020753904b50a550f194a5f5664dff91b70601e31f0ac
```

If you want the CLI flow instead:

```bash
pip install -e ".[cli]"

python scripts/generate_passport_template.py --passport-type model --output forkit-passport.json
python scripts/validate_passport.py --path forkit-passport.json
```

That flow creates a starter `ModelPassport`, writes a deterministic `id` into `forkit-passport.json`, and verifies that the stored `id` still matches the schema-derived identity. No hosted service is required.

## Why This Exists

`forkit-core` makes the passport itself the durable boundary for AI identity.
Instead of depending on one registry, one dashboard, or one runtime, you keep a
portable document that can be created locally, reviewed in Git, validated in
CI, synced across environments, and re-verified later without changing its
identity.

This repository is for teams that want:

- deterministic `passport_id` derivation for models and agents
- provenance links and artifact hashes that stay attached to the passport
- lineage across base models, fine-tunes, and agents
- local-first workflows that do not require a hosted control plane
- a verification path that fits normal repository and CI practices

## What This Is And Isn't

What it is:

- a deterministic identity contract for AI models and agents
- a portable passport document with provenance, artifact hashes, and lineage
- a local-first SDK, CLI, registry, and CI validation path

What it is not:

- a claim that the model is safe, legal, or approved
- a hosted team governance product by itself
- a replacement for model cards, SBOMs, or attestations

`forkit-core` is meant to complement those artifacts by giving the model or agent
itself a stable portable identity that other review and governance layers can
join on.

## Common Questions

**Why not just use model cards?**

Model cards are useful documentation, but they are not deterministic identity.
`forkit-core` gives the passport a rebuildable `passport_id` that can be
re-derived and verified locally.

**Why not just use attestations or SBOMs?**

Attestations and SBOMs are important evidence formats. `forkit-core` is the
identity layer they can attach to. It focuses on stable identity, lineage, and
portable provenance rather than replacing supply-chain evidence standards.

**Does `forkit-core` verify that a claim is true?**

No. It verifies that a passport's deterministic identity still matches its
declared contents. Truth, ownership, and publication claims still require
source proof, review, or hosted governance workflows.

## Current Scope

- Deterministic `ModelPassport` and `AgentPassport` records
- Local JSON passports with a rebuildable SQLite index
- Python SDK, CLI, validation scripts, and local HTTP service
- GitHub CI validation for committed passport files
- Framework adapters for LangGraph, LangChain, and OpenClaw
- File-based Hugging Face model card export
- A prototype browser UI under [`web/`](./web), clearly separate from any hosted control plane

Current maturity:

- Alpha open-source core, but the identity contract and deterministic verification behavior are already stable enough to evaluate seriously
- PyPI is not live yet
- advanced flows such as hosted import preparation, self-host sync, adapters, and the prototype UI exist, but they are not the primary first-use path

Public install path:

```bash
pip install "forkit-core @ git+https://github.com/Forkit-Dev-Core/Forkit_Dev.git"
```

## Primary and Advanced Paths

| Goal | Maturity | Entry point |
|---|---|
| Deterministic identity demo | Primary | `python examples/deterministic_identity_demo.py` |
| Smallest end-to-end local registration flow | Primary | `python examples/sdk_quickstart.py` |
| Register from YAML through the CLI | Primary | `forkit register model examples/register_model.yaml` |
| Validate a committed passport in CI | Primary | [`publish/github-ci-demo/`](./publish/github-ci-demo/) |
| Run the local HTTP service | Primary | `pip install -e ".[server]" && forkit serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000` |

| Explore the browser UI prototype | Early | `cd web && npm install && npm run dev` |

## `forkit-core` and Forkit.dev

`forkit-core` is the local-first open-source foundation in this repository:
schemas, deterministic IDs, artifact hashing, lineage, local registry, SDK,
CLI, sync primitives, optional local service, adapters, and the prototype web
UI.

`Forkit.dev` is the broader hosted direction around that core for teams that
prefer browser-based passport creation, dashboards, private workspaces,
telemetry, collaboration, approvals, and governance workflows. Those hosted
workflows are not implemented in this repository today.

## Identity Boundary

`forkit-core` uses the deterministic `passport_id` as the canonical
portable identity for a passport.

If a passport is later published or connected to a hosted Forkit deployment,
the hosted system must preserve that `passport_id` and attach any hosted or
public identity as additional application metadata. Hosted layers may join on
`passport_id`, but they must not rewrite it.

This repository does not implement a hosted account, claim, or publish flow
today. It implements the local identity contract that those future workflows
must respect.

## Install

Python 3.10+ is required. Node.js 20.19+ is only needed if you want to run the
frontend prototype.

Install from this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Forkit-Dev-Core/Forkit_Dev.git
cd Forkit_Dev
pip install -e .
```

Optional extras:

```bash
pip install -e ".[pydantic]"   # Pydantic v2 backend + JSON Schema
pip install -e ".[cli]"        # Typer CLI + YAML input
pip install -e ".[langchain]"  # LangChain adapter helpers
pip install -e ".[langgraph]"  # LangGraph adapter helpers
pip install -e ".[server]"     # FastAPI + Uvicorn local service
pip install -e ".[postgres]"   # Postgres-backed sync receiver
pip install -e ".[all]"        # all optional extras
pip install -e ".[dev]"        # tests, linting, and development tooling
```

Python imports should use `forkit.*`. The legacy `forkit_core.*` namespace is
kept as a compatibility shim in `v0.1.x`.

## Core Concepts

- `passport_id`: deterministic SHA-256 identity derived from stable passport fields
- `artifact_hash`: content fingerprint for a model artifact, agent bundle, or config material
- `parent_hash`: hash-chain link to the parent artifact in a lineage
- `base_model_id` and `parent_agent_id`: passport-ID lineage links for fine-tunes and forks
- local registry: JSON source of truth with a rebuildable SQLite index
- sync bridge: generic `GET /export` and `POST /sync/passports` contract that does not rewrite identity

For the full identity contract, hash rules, regression anchors, and
serialization guarantees, see [`docs/identity-spec.md`](./docs/identity-spec.md).

## What's Inside

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `forkit/` | Core package: domain logic, schemas, registry, SDK, server, and sync |
| `forkit_core/` | Compatibility namespace kept during the `v0.1.x` transition |
| `forkit_langgraph/` | LangGraph adapter helpers |
| `forkit_langchain/` | LangChain adapter helpers |
| `forkit_openclaw/` | OpenClaw adapter |
| `examples/` | Runnable quickstarts and sample passports |
| `publish/` | Copyable GitHub CI and publishing demos |
| `scripts/` | Validation, export, and template utilities |
| `web/` | React + TypeScript + Vite prototype UI |
| `docs/` | Identity specification and image assets |
| `tests/` | Regression coverage for schemas, registry, server, sync, and adapters |

## GitHub CI Validation

`forkit-core` includes a lightweight GitHub-native validation path for a
committed passport file. It checks that the file exists, validates the JSON
against the current `ModelPassport` or `AgentPassport` schema, and verifies
that the stored deterministic `id` matches the file content.

Start with [`publish/github-ci-demo/`](./publish/github-ci-demo/):

1. Copy [`publish/github-ci-demo/forkit-passport.json`](./publish/github-ci-demo/forkit-passport.json) into your repository root.
2. Copy the sample workflow from [`publish/github-ci-demo/README.md`](./publish/github-ci-demo/README.md) or the local reusable action shown below.
3. Push or open a pull request.
4. GitHub Actions will fail on missing files, invalid JSON, schema errors, or deterministic `id` mismatches.

Minimal workflow:

```yaml
name: Validate Forkit passport

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - "forkit-passport.json"
      - ".github/workflows/validate-forkit-passport.yml"
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - "forkit-passport.json"
      - ".github/workflows/validate-forkit-passport.yml"

jobs:
  validate-passport:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: Forkit-Dev-Core/Forkit_Dev/.github/actions/validate-passport@main
        with:
          passport-path: forkit-passport.json
```

Run the same check locally:

```bash
python scripts/validate_passport.py --path forkit-passport.json
```

This repository's own workflow validates
[`examples/forkit-passport.model.json`](./examples/forkit-passport.model.json).

## Python SDK

```python
from forkit.sdk import ForkitClient

client = ForkitClient()  # defaults to ~/.forkit/registry

model_id = client.models.register(
    name="my-model",
    version="1.0.0",
    task_type="text-generation",
    architecture="transformer",
    creator={"name": "Your Team", "organization": "Open Source"},
)

agent_id = client.agents.register(
    name="support-agent",
    version="1.0.0",
    model_id=model_id,
    task_type="customer-support",
    architecture="ReAct",
    creator={"name": "Your Team", "organization": "Open Source"},
    system_prompt="Answer concisely.",
)

print(client.lineage.ancestors(agent_id))
print(client.verify(model_id))
```

Runnable entry point:

```bash
python examples/sdk_quickstart.py
```

## CLI

Install the CLI extra first:

```bash
pip install -e ".[cli]"
```

If `forkit` is not on your `PATH`, use `python -m forkit.cli.main ...` with
the same arguments.

Repository and package branding uses `forkit-core`. The local CLI binary stays
`forkit` intentionally so the user-facing command remains short and stable.

Common commands:

```bash
forkit register model examples/register_model.yaml
forkit register agent examples/register_agent.yaml

forkit inspect <passport-id>
forkit list --type model --status active
forkit search "llama"
forkit lineage <passport-id>
forkit verify <passport-id>
forkit hosted-proof <passport-id>
forkit stats

forkit sync status
forkit sync push https://example.com/sync/passports --target main-server
forkit sync pull https://example.com/export --source remote-dev
```

The CLI is local-first. `forkit sync push` and `forkit sync pull` are generic
sync primitives for self-hosted or custom HTTP endpoints that preserve
`passport_id`. They are not a hosted Forkit publish or claim flow.

`examples/register_model.yaml` is runnable as checked in. `examples/register_agent.yaml`
is a second-step sample and expects an already registered model passport ID in `model_id`.

When you want to bind an OSS passport into hosted Forkit later, first register
or create the passport locally, then run `forkit hosted-proof <passport-id>`.
That command looks up the passport in your local registry and
prints the exact `/.well-known/forkit-verify.txt` proof line and target URL for
supported GitHub, Hugging Face, and GitLab sources.

## Local Service and Sync

Install the server extra and run the local HTTP service over the same
filesystem-backed registry:

```bash
pip install -e ".[server]"
forkit serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Relevant routes:

- `GET /` for service info
- `GET /healthz` and `GET /readyz` for liveness/readiness checks
- `POST /models` and `POST /agents` for passport registration
- `GET /passports/{id}` and `POST /verify/{id}` for fetch and verification
- `GET /lineage/{id}` for ancestry and descendants
- `GET /export` and `POST /sync/passports` for generic sync

Security posture for the local service:

- keep `forkit serve` on `127.0.0.1` unless you intentionally place it behind a trusted network boundary
- set `FORKIT_SYNC_BEARER_TOKEN` before exposing `POST /sync/passports` beyond localhost
- treat the local service as a developer or self-host primitive, not a public hosted control plane

The repository also includes a runnable self-host demo:

```bash
python examples/self_host_sync_quickstart.py
```

That example starts two local registries, pushes one registry's outbox into the
other's inbox, then pulls exported passports into the mirror registry.

If you need the Postgres-backed receiver, install `.[postgres]` and set:

- `FORKIT_SYNC_BACKEND=postgres`
- `FORKIT_SYNC_POSTGRES_DSN=postgresql://...`
- `FORKIT_SYNC_POSTGRES_SCHEMA=public`
- `FORKIT_SYNC_BEARER_TOKEN=...`

## Framework Adapters

`forkit-core` ships thin adapters that preserve the same passport contract
while helping you register framework-specific runtime surfaces.

### LangGraph

- Package: [`forkit_langgraph/`](./forkit_langgraph)
- Example: [`examples/langgraph_sync_quickstart.py`](./examples/langgraph_sync_quickstart.py)
- Install: `pip install -e ".[langgraph]"`

The current adapter supports spec-based registration and runtime-oriented
helpers around builder or compiled graph objects.

### LangChain

- Package: [`forkit_langchain/`](./forkit_langchain)
- Examples: [`examples/langchain_quickstart.py`](./examples/langchain_quickstart.py) and [`examples/langchain_sync_quickstart.py`](./examples/langchain_sync_quickstart.py)
- Install: `pip install -e ".[langchain]"`

The current adapter captures tool metadata and lightweight runtime summaries
without turning the core package into a hard LangChain dependency.

### OpenClaw

- Package: [`forkit_openclaw/`](./forkit_openclaw)
- Example: [`examples/openclaw_quickstart.py`](./examples/openclaw_quickstart.py)

The OpenClaw adapter derives a standard `AgentPassport` from local gateway and
plugin configuration material such as `openclaw.json`, plugin manifests,
extension entrypoints, and hook metadata.

## Hugging Face Model Card Export

Forkit passports add deterministic identity, integrity-ready hashes, and
lineage fields on top of a normal model card workflow. This repo includes a
small compatibility exporter that converts a `ModelPassport` JSON file into a
Hugging Face-style markdown card with YAML front matter.

Included files:

- [`scripts/export_hf_model_card.py`](./scripts/export_hf_model_card.py)
- [`examples/forkit-passport.model.json`](./examples/forkit-passport.model.json)
- [`examples/huggingface-model-card.md`](./examples/huggingface-model-card.md)

Run it locally:

```bash
python scripts/export_hf_model_card.py \
  --path examples/forkit-passport.model.json \
  --output examples/huggingface-model-card.md
```

This exporter is file-based only. It does not call the Hugging Face API.

## Frontend Prototype

A React + TypeScript + Vite frontend lives under [`web/`](./web). It is
included for exploration of the current open-source scope, not as proof of a
hosted control plane.

Current behavior:

- mock-backed in-memory data, not persistent API-backed state
- screens for home, dashboard, registry, search, passport detail, create, verify, lineage, and stats
- useful for demos and product exploration while the durable OSS value stays in the schemas, local registry, SDK, CLI, and examples

Run it locally:

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Additional commands:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Design Principles

- Offline first. Identity and integrity operations do not require a running service.
- Deterministic identity. The same stable inputs always produce the same `passport_id`.
- Hash-chain provenance. `artifact_hash` and `parent_hash` give you verifiable lineage without central coordination.
- Local JSON as source of truth. SQLite is an index, not the identity authority.
- Keep application metadata outside the identity boundary. Extra UI or sync state should join on `passport_id`, not rewrite it.

For deeper details, read [`docs/identity-spec.md`](./docs/identity-spec.md) and
run [`examples/use_cases.py`](./examples/use_cases.py).

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution workflow,
expectations, and release-sensitive areas.

Before opening a pull request:

- run `ruff check .`
- run `pytest`
- run `python -m build` if you changed packaging or install-facing docs
- run `npm run build` and `npm run lint` in `web/` if you changed the frontend
- update [`docs/identity-spec.md`](./docs/identity-spec.md), examples, and regression tests when you change identity or verification behavior
- do not change `compute_id` without updating the spec and regression anchors

## Roadmap

Near-term open-source priorities:

- strengthen self-hosted registry and sync workflows
- connect more of the web prototype to real local registry and service flows
- deepen framework adapters while keeping the core dependency-light
- improve contributor documentation and adoption examples for serious teams
